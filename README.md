# ProjectTango_AndroidStudio [Android]
Converted Android Studio projects for Google Project Tango  (2015-05-19  Version 1.1 Leibniz)
- Will update to latest 1.11 Nash in days)

Project Tango is an experimental projects from Google which used camera and IR for getting depth images.
Developers can use this for creating 3D modules.
But those samples are for eclipse projects, not the Android Studio projects.
I am developing Project Tango projects for crime scene investigation, so I converted them to Android Studio! 
Hope this can save some time for uses who need Android Studio version :)
